<p> It’s so hard to leave your new puppy at home, but we’re here to make sure they are loved and given plenty of attention for when you aren’t there. We can visit for potty breaks to help them stick to their puppy training schedule and ensure they are safe and happy! </p>
<p> Puppies who are under six months old are usually still mastering potty training. Your puppy should be able to hold it for as many months they are old. ( e.g. one month old pups would be able to hold it in for one hour. ) </p>
<p> Since puppies need trips outside every few hours, you can schedule as many visits as you need to make sure they stay comfortable and get consistent breaks during the day. </p>
